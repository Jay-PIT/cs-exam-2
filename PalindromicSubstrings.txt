Palindromic Substrings

This problem asks how many palindromic subtrings there are in a single substring. A palindrome is a word that can be 
read the same forwards and backwards.

In order to solve the problem, we determine if all possible substrings are palindromes. We build each substring by 
starting with the first character and building up from there; once we analyze every substring with that character, we 
move on to the next until all characters are used. We analyze the substring by comparing its characters on opposite 
sides: if they are all equal, then it is a palindrome. We add each palindrome to a counter; once we are done scanning, 
we return the counter.

We need the input string, an integer for a counter, a string to build our substrings, and a boolean to determine if the 
substring should be added to the counter.
