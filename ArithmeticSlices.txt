Arithmetic Slices

This problem asks how many arithmetic sequences there are in an array of integers. An arithmetic sequence is a 
increasing or decreasing sequence of at least three elements that always have the same difference between elements.

In order to solve this problem, we determine if every possible sequence is arithmetic. We start with the first element 
of the sequence, build up from there, and, once done, we move to the next element. We determine the difference between 
elements by subtracting the first element from the second (don't use absolute values in case the sequence is 
decreasing). From there, we determine if the next element matches the difference from the previous one; if it does, we 
add to a counter representing arithmetic sequences. We continue building up the slice until either the difference 
between elemnets doesn't match or it reaches the end (if it reaches the end, all sequences between it and the current 
first element are arithmetic; escape the loop accordingly). We then return the counter.

We only need the input array and an integer to count the number of arithmetic sequences.
